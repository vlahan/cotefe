Description:
The Testbed Server is a Django project implementing the Testbed Adaptation API (TAA).
The TAA is a RESTful API exposes the testbed functionalities as REST resources which can be manipulated through a uniform interface (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
It uses JSON as resource representation format, but if may be easily extended to XML, YAML and other formats.
This project basically consists of 3 parts:
- Resource Models: for compatibility reasons (with the Google App Engine's Datastore), the resource models have been designed accordingly to non-relational database.
- URL Dispatcher: Piston has been selected as a framework for forwarding HTTP requests to handlers, which generate HTTP responses.
- Resource Representation: the resource representation structure provided by Piston is the standard Django model serialization, which is different from the structure we designed for the TAA resources. For this reason brand new customized Piston Emitters will be designed.

In the first phase, the Testbed Server will ONLY implement read-only features.

This project requires the following Python libraries:

django-nonrel/django => <project>/django
djangotoolbox => <project>/djangotoolbox
django-piston/piston => <project>/piston
