				<h3>COTEFE a Collective Platform</h3>
				<p>
					The development of a common Integrated Testbed to be used within the 
					community is one of the most important issues of CONET. Although most 
					partners already have individual testbeds in their own labs, there is 
					no single physical environment that can be used for Cooperating Objects. 
					This gap will be closed by the CONET Testbed and the Testbed Integration activities.</br></br>

					Thus, the main objective of the task, lead by AICIA, is to develop a 
					common testbed for cooperating objects. The following main elements 
					are involved in the IT: 5 autonomous robotic systems and a set of 
					static and mobile WSN nodes. All these cooperating objects have diverse 
					sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. 
					The robots also have sensor nodes, being mobile nodes of the network. 
					This testbed will make possible the research, development, testing, 
					validation and comparison of different techniques, algorithms and +
					applications regarding cooperative objects. The CONET Integrated Testbed, 
					in operation since September 2009, is located in AICIA premises in Seville, Spain.
