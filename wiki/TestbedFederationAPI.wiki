In the following table we provide a list of all typical operations a member testbed exposes in terms of application of HTTP methods to resources. As mentioned above, all resources are represented by default in JSON format. It means that for method GET, a JSON representation of the specified resource (or list of resources) is provided while for methods PUT and POST, representation of the updated or to-be-created resource must be included in the HTTP request body.
