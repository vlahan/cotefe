Experiment Specification

Experiment specification (3 groups of nodes: gateway/subscriber, passive nodes/publishers, interference nodes)
TMote Sky (1 node for subscriber)
n-1-m publishers
m interferers OPTIONAL (NOT FOR THE TU DELFT) movable interferer
number of nodes CHECK HOW MANY NODES DELFT HAVE
n = 100, m = 5, platform TMote Sky
3 property sets
User uploads 3 different Images
Virtual Node Groups - User creates 3 VNG according to the PropertySets
Virtual Tasks
install image 1 to the virtual node group 1
install image 2 to the virtual node group 2
install image 3 to the virtual node group 3
(delay 30 secs)
inject following message to virtual node 1 (subscriber/sinks)
(start tracing)
(delay some time to establish)
inject interference pattern command which influences the communication in the network and reduces the goodput and this should be observed in the base station somehow (reduce goodput)
(delay 120 sec)
another injection = stop interfering
will observe better goodput
OPTIONAL WITH MOVABLE NODE we supply a movement pattern
(stop tracing)

Resource Reservation

Information about timing (days, hours, months)
User must be able to say “as soon as possible”
OPTIONAL: repeatable jobs (every week, every day, etc.)
Select 2 testbeds (TWIST and TU Delft) at the same time
Experiment Execution

Testbed independent real time control
